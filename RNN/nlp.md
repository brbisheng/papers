## natural language.

- Bag of words
- Term Frequency ~ Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF). to improve the bag of words by adjusting the weights.
- Token ~ tokenization (cutting a text into pieces) (but some words can not be separated by space " ")
- stop words removal
- stemming (affixes == prefixes / suffixes)
  - prefixes are always derivational (system --> ecosystem)
  - suffixes can be derivational (guitar --> guitarist), or inflectional (fast-->faster)
- lemmatization - going back to the dictionary form or the lemma. (to reach the root form of a word)
- topic modelling ~ each text consists of several topics.
- latent dirichlet allocation ~
  - application in recommender system
  
- linguistics (词性) and semantics (语义) differences
- linguistics
  - point of speech (pos)
  
- co-reference analysis
  - named entity resolution: (https://www.rosette.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-entity-extraction-ner-and-entity-resolution/)
- modality (related to speaker's attitude toward a proposition.)
- themantic roles (e.g. agent + instrument + theme + experiencer): http://www.linguisticsnetwork.com/semantics-thematic-roles/
  - themantic relations: 

- Phrase: np, vp, pp, cp
  - constituency grammar (the whole tree composition) and dependency grammer (somehow derivative, with some leaves removed)
